    "Haruka Academy. I was once a student here, and my time was... exciting, to say the least. It was hard to belive that I would be back here again, working for the school rather than studying in it."
    "As I approached the school gate, I scanned the inner courtyard."
    shinn "This place is awfully calm."
    thinking "Not surprising, since it's after-hours."
    thinking "Ah, but even without students around, seeing the campus again sure brings back memories."
    "Laughing under my breath, I immediately went to the principal's office."

    shinn "Well, that settles it."
    "The meeting with the principal had been quite simple. All I had to do was heelp a series of students with their studies. Apparently, those on the list he had given me exceeded in athletics but were simply helpless in arithmetic."
    "Conveniently enough, all of them were female senior students. Close to finishing their studies and beginning adult life."
    shinn "*chuckle* I guess it's natural for athletes to suck at more complex subjects."
    thinking "Speaking of, I wonder if those students have arrived yet?"
    thinking "First, I should scout this place and get used to the schedules. They can't be too different from when I was here."
    "I looked at the schedule the principal gave me during our meeting."
    thinking "Let's see... who should I check out first..."
